## Reads out the sensors from the Pimoroni EnviropHAT and sonifies these in Puredata

* Needs Raspberry Pi W with Jessie or Stretch
* Do the OTG thing: https://gist.github.com/gbaman/975e2db164b3ca2b51ae11e45e8fd40a
* Make sure the Pi Zero is POWERED WELL. For the amp it needs separate power otherwise will keep rebooting!!
* Stick the EnviroPHAT and Adafruit Speaker Bonnet on.
* Install both the softwares:
* EnviroPHAT: https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/sandyj/getting-started-with-enviro-phat
* https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-speaker-bonnet-for-raspberry-pi/overview
* This should work.
